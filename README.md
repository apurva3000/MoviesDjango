MoviesDjango
============

Just playing around with Python &amp; Django Framework.
This time am not writing a large Readme file, since am quite new to Django and still need to try out various things in it.

You could see some of the basic things implemented by running the code. DB used was sqlite. In-built http server of Django used.
Movies is the domain we are playing with, provided some data (very less) in initial data file, which can be used by syncdb.
Models have been created, so have been some views and you could see the url patterns for how to open them by seeing the urls.py of the moviesApp application, 
which btw is our app & has been configured into the settings.

Still plenty of things to add on. I'll keep doing it as soon as I get free time.
